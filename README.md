## 🔍 Overview
The **Crypto Guess Challenge** is my web-based single-page game that tests your knowledge of cryptocurrencies. You have to use hints given to guess the right coin don't worry if you guess it wrong 😭😭

## Features
- Real-time data using the [CoinPaprika API](https://api.coinpaprika.com/) its always updating in short

- Hints like:
  - Symbol 
  - Market Rank
  - Price in USD
  - Market Cap
  - First Letter of Name
  - Launch Year

- Score tracking across 3 rounds

- Sleek results reveal screen with coin info

- Fully single-page application

- Interactive card-based UI with changing content

- try again button to replay the challenge

## 🤓Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Markup
- **CSS3** – Styling and card layout
- **JavaScript** – Game logic, API interaction, and dynamic rendering
- **CoinPaprika API** – Real crypto data

## How It Works

1. Click **get guessing**.
2. A random cryptocurrency is chosen.
3. You'll see hints like symbol, rank, price, market cap, and more
4. Type in your guess and submit it.
5. Get instant feedback on your answer (not it😭/on point😍).
6. Repeat for 3 rounds.
7. View your final score and the actual coin names.
8. Click **try again** to play again.

## Learning Goals Met

- Consumes public API asynchronously using `fetch` and handles JSON responses.
-  Single-page interface with no reloads or redirects.
-  Uses at least 3 distinct `addEventListener()` types:
  - `click` – get guessing / try again
  - `submit` – Guess
- Array iteration with `.filter()` or `.map()` for coin selection and hint generation.
-  DRY and modular code structure with reusable functions and clean logic.


##  Run the App
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enjoy guessing!
